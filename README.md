# Tutorials
A repo of all the tutorials i've done to learn different languages

Java-basic is all the basic tutorials I did to learn basic Java.  It's pretty similar to C++ actually.

CPP-basic is the basic tutorials I used to learn basic C++.  I'm actually redoing the whole unit for this repo to review.
